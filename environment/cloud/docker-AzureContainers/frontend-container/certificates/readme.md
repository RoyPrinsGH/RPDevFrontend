# Frontend certificates

This folder is SSOT for the SSL certificates required for the NGINX container to work under the domain name royprins.dev.

[SSL certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) are digital certificates that provide secure communication between a client and a server. They are used to encrypt data transmitted over the internet, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties.

These files are not committed and will not be given away, so if you want to run the docker container, modify the NGINX config to accept HTTP-only requests.
